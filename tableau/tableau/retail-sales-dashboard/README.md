# Retail Sales Dashboard (Tableau)

Imagine you’re an entrepreneur looking to open a food service start-up in Bangalore. Before executing your plan, you’d naturally have a few questions. To address these, we created a dashboard using Zomato Bangalore data from Kaggle to help you find answers and make informed decisions.

## Cuisine Preference (Tree Map)

Firstly, what cuisine should your eatery offer? What do people in Bangalore prefer?
For this, we used a tree map, where the size of each block indicates the share of orders across different cuisines. From the chart, we can see that South Indian cuisine dominates, followed by North Indian, and then others. From this, we can infer that you should start with Indian cuisine while also incorporating options like fast food and beverages.

## Average Cost of Two ( Bar Chart )

This graph shows the average cost per person for two people across different restaurant types. Bar are the most expensive, followed by casual dining and cafes and then quick bites, sweet shops come in the affordable range usually below 250. From here it is know restaurant type strongly affects cost. Premium experiences like bars and casual dining charge higher prices, while quick, everyday options like sweet shops or takeaway services are much cheaper.

## Rating Distribution (Histogram)

Finally, looking at the rating distribution, we see a normal-like pattern, with most ratings concentrated between 3.6 and 3.9. This suggests that customers generally perceive restaurants as average, and that competition is strong within this range. Achieving ratings above this band could help your start-up stand out.

## Table Booking ( Pie Chart )

This chart shows whether customers usually book tables in advance. A large majority of orders in a restaurant are placed without table booking (almost 90–95%). Only a very small fraction of people actually use the table booking option. Most customers prefer walk-in or online ordering rather than making reservations. This could be due to many reasons, like restaurants not encouraging table bookings, or customers not finding it necessary except for premium dining experiences.

## Order Preference (Pie Chart)

Next, let’s look at consumer behaviour. Do people prefer ordering online or dining out?
Here, online orders dominate, clearly showing that customers prefer food delivery at home. From this, we can infer that you could initially start with a cloud kitchen before opening a physical restaurant, allowing you to build capital and a customer base first.

## Rating vs Price ( Scatter Plot )

This chart illustrates the relationship between restaurant ratings and the average cost for two people. The scatter plot reveals a moderate positive correlation: as a restaurant's rating increases, the cost for two people tends to rise. Most restaurants fall in the 3.5 to 4.5 rating range, with average costs clustered around ₹300–₹600.

Here, the darkness of the circles indicates the number of ratings; the darker the circle, the more ratings it has, indicating that more people are going or ordering from that restaurant.Overall, the chart highlights that higher-rated restaurants are usually associated with higher costs.
