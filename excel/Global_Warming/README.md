# People Surviving Global Warming  
### Excel Dashboard on Household Assets & Climate Change Impacts

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project presents an **Excel-based interactive dashboard** that explores how people in selected Asian countries are coping with **climate change and global warming**, with a focus on **household living conditions, basic facilities, and climate-related impacts on daily life**.

The dashboard was created as part of a **group assignment** for the course *Introduction to Excel and Macros*, in accordance with the prescribed academic guidelines.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, especially in developing countries.  
This project attempts to answer key questions such as:
- How do living conditions differ across countries affected by climate change?
- Do people have access to basic facilities like housing, water, and sanitation?
- How is climate change affecting livelihoods and work?
- How do households cope with rising temperatures and heat stress?

The dashboard tells a **data-driven story** on how people are surviving and adapting to global warming.
